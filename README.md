## Star Wars Text Scroller


</div>

### Description

I wrote this for my friend Andrew who needed a Star-Wars-Style credits for his math project. The speed is adjustable, as well as font and everything else. The maximum number of lines is the upper bound of the arrays. The AlphaBlend API (which, along with a few other functions, I got from some unknown author) requires Windows 98 or greater. It took forever to work out the bugs, so please vote. Hope you like it.
